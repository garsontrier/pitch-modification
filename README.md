Pitch Modification on Speech Signals using PSOLA Algorithm

Simple pitch modification program implements Pitch-Synchronous Overlap Add Algorithm on top of YIN pitch detection algorithm. 

The program segments the speech using pitch information from the pitch detector and allows user to change each segment's pitch independently.

Simple Console based GUI was implemented for ease of use.

Python 3.6

Required libraries: numpy, librosa, scipy, matplotlib
